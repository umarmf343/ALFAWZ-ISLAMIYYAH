# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain the latest minor release from the `main` branch. Security fixes will be backported to the most recent tagged release when feasible. Older releases are considered end-of-life and will not receive patches.

| Version | Supported          |
|---------|--------------------|
| main    | ✅ Supported       |
| < latest tag - 1 | ⚠️ Best effort (critical fixes only) |
| Older releases | ❌ Unsupported |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please help keep the community safe by emailing [security@alfawz.example](mailto:security@alfawz.example) with the following details:

- Description of the vulnerability and the potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or proof of concept
- Any known mitigations or workarounds
- Your contact information for follow-up (PGP key optional)

Avoid opening public issues for security concerns.

## Disclosure Process

1. We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **3 business days**.
2. The team will investigate, prioritize, and work on a fix. We may contact you for additional information.
3. Once a fix is ready, we will coordinate a release window with you (when possible) and provide an estimated timeline.
4. After the fix is deployed, we will publish a security advisory summarizing the vulnerability, impact, and remediation steps.

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit reporters who wish to be acknowledged.
